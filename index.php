		<!-- Here's a brief little bio -->
			<p>Today's actually my birthday believe it or not! I just turned 27. I went to school in Boston, and I'm originally from Upstate NY. This year, I got into programming. I started off learning object-oriented programming through Java and Python. Man, that had a steep learning curve. This eventually got me interested in web development specifically. I learned some HTML, CSS, and Javascript afterwards, and now you see me here in your class. Thank god I learned how to have <b>perserverance</b> during my initial studies, because setting up this version control stuff was (<b>no exaggeration</b>) one of <b>THE</b> most confusing things I've ever attempted to learn.</p>

		<h3>No worries though. I understand it now though. Otherwise, you wouldn't be seeing this wonderful little bio..</h3>  
			<p>I wrote my HTML and CSS with Sublime Text 2 Editor. So far I'm enjoying using its feautures. I can't wait to start
			learning how to create some nice applications for these pages!</p>
		<h5>(Though shhhhh..don't tell anyone, but I think I'll have to practice injecting more style into my page! Not bad for a simple first assignment though, I must say)</h5>
