		<h3>But what's your <b>NAME</b>??</h3>
			<p>...Oh yes, of course, my name...I'm <b>Zach Postle</b></p>
		<h2>Guess what...</h2>
		<!-- Here's a brief little bio -->
			<p>Today's actually my birthday believe it or not! I just turned 27.
			   I went to school in Boston, and I'm originally from Upstate NY.
			   This year, I got into programming. I started off learning object-
			   oriented programming through Java and Python. Man, that had a steep
			   learning curve. This eventually got me interested in web development
			   specifically. I learned some HTML, CSS, and Javascript afterwards, 
			   and now you see me here in your class. Thank god I learned how to
			   have <b>perserverance</b> during my initial studies, because setting
			   up this version control stuff was (<b>no exaggeration</b>) one of <b>
			   THE</b> most confusing things I've ever attempted to learn.</p>

		<h3>No worries though. I understand it now though. Otherwise, you wouldn't 
			be seeing this wonderful little bio..</h3>
